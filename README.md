# Shell_Automation_Scripts

## Overview
This repository contains **8 Bash scripts** developed as part of **Weekend Shell Scripts Challenge**.  
The scripts automate common tasks such as backups, disk monitoring, deployment simulation, process checking, log analysis, file cleanup, API data fetching, and cron simulation.  

All scripts were developed and tested on **MSYS/Zsh**.

## 📂 Scripts Included

1. **backup_projects.sh** – Automatically backs up projects with timestamp logs.
2. **disk_monitor.sh** – Monitors disk usage and logs alerts if usage exceeds threshold.
3. **deploy_app.sh** – Simulates pulling latest code, installing dependencies, and restarting services.
4. **check_process.sh** – Verifies if a process is running and logs actions.
5. **user_info.sh** – Displays username, home directory, shell, and current date/time.
6. **log_analyzer.sh** – Counts errors and warnings in a log file and displays summary.
7. **cleanup_old_files.sh** – Deletes `.tmp` and `.log` files older than 7 days.
8. **api_fetch.sh** – Fetches live JSON data from a public API (weather information).
9. **cron_simulation.sh** – Simulates running a script daily at a scheduled time.
